# Stock_prices_prediction

This project is a quick work of predicting simultaneously the prices of 3 stocks in the french stock market :
* **LVMH** : Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, World leader in luxury goods
* **Peugeot** : French car manufacturer
* **Mercialys** : expert in the management, transformation and enhancement of shopping centers

The prediction has been better estimated by a **Decision Tree Regressor**

## Model Building  

I built the same two different models for each stock to predict their prices:
*	**Multiple Linear Regression**
*	**Decision Tree Regressor**

## Models performance 
The performances are presented as follows by these graphs :
